Device tree for AOSP  HTC Marvelc

To build, you must patch the vendor folders and run extract-files.sh on a marvelc running CM7. I can only fix so much, be running a more or less bugless ROM.

To build run

. build/envsetup.sh
lunch
choose cyanogen_marvelc-eng
make -jx bacon

*x = the number of threads your processor has (threads not cores)
